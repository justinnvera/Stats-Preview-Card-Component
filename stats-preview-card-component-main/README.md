### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned how to use CSS Grid and how to display Flex containers inside it aswell. 

## Continued Development

I had a really hard time with the mobile responsiveness for this project. I couldn't get the `.container` to adjust to the overflowing vertical size of `.stats`. I decided against using fixed a `height` at first but since I couldn't find any solutions, I was left with no choice. If you have any suggestions or feedback that might fix this, feel free to shoot me  a message.
